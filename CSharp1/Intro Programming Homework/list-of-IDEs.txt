In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base
workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java,
Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used
to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell,
JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and
Erlang.

NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, but also
with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5. It is also an application platform 
framework for Java desktop applications and others. The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on
Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM. The NetBeans Platform 
allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. 
Applications based on the NetBeans Platform (including the NetBeans IDE itself) can be extended by 
third party developers.

Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools
developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. Xcode supports C, C++, Objective-C, 
Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python, Ruby, Rez, and Swift source code with a variety of 
programming models, including but not limited to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java. Third parties have added 
support for GNU Pascal, Free Pascal, Ada, C#, Perl and D.

Code::Blocks is a free, open source cross-platform IDE which supports multiple compilers including 
GCC, Clang and Visual C++. It is developed in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit. Using a plugin 
architecture, its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins. Currently, 
Code::Blocks is oriented towards C, C++, and Fortran. It has a custom build system and optional Make 
support. Code::Blocks is being developed for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X and has been ported to 
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.

Komodo Edit is a free text editor for dynamic programming languages. It was introduced in January 2007
to complement Active State's commercial Komodo IDE. With the release of version 4.3, Komodo Edit is 
built on top of the Open Komodo project. Many of Komodo's features are derived from an embedded Python
interpreter. Open Komodo uses Mozilla and Scintilla code base as they share many features and support
the same languages (including Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Tcl, SQL, Smarty, CSS, HTML and XML) and 
computer platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows).
