XML Namespaces provide a method to avoid element name conflicts. 
They are defined in a W3C recommendation. An XML instance may contain 
element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary. If each 
vocabulary is given a namespace, the ambiguity between identically 
named elements or attributes can be resolved.
